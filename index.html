            <p class="intro">
                My name is Esteban Rubén Mangas Calva, and I am member of the Church of Jesus Christ
                of Latter-day Saints. In the church I serve as first counselor of the sunday school in my ward.
                I'm from Mexico, and actually I'm a programmer and web development student from BYU
                Pathway Worldwide. I'm married and have a small business of creative and personalized
                stationary, along with personalized vinil works with my wife. I'm a fan of Harry Potter,
                Pokémon and Anime. I hope to work someday in a position or company related to my hoobies.
                At last, but not least, I love videogames and technology; wich is part of the focus and passion
                I have as I'm discovering the marvels of being a programmer and web developer.
